Backstory
---------

Everything was good in the world of Acquesitia. Adventurers' endless appetites for acquiring newer and better loot from killing evil creatures ensured that the forces of evil would always be kept at bay.

Then, one day, the Real Money Auction House was established, and everything went to hell. Adventurers could now buy and sell items with their endless supplies of mythical Real Currency, causing the established gold standard to bottom out. After awhile, adventurers stopped using gold to trade items altogether, preferring to deal solely with Real Currency.

While the adventurers of the world traded items and Real Currency back and forth, the forces of evil, no longer being farmed for their loot, rose to power for the first time in milennia. They began to terrorize the civilizations of Acquesitia, and the adventurers, no longer equipped to fight, found themselves unable to fight back.

You are Stebbins, a grizzled old adventurer who was all set to have an easy retirement as an item vendor (as is often the case for aged heroes), but then all this happened. First, vendors were rendered obsolete because of Real Currency, and then the forces of evil rose to power and started terrorizing everyone.

Despite being Too Old For This Shit, Stebbins sets out to right the wrongs of the world, the only way he knows: capitalism.


Act I
-----

__Day 1__

You start off with only a handful a handful of gray items, some gold, and a set of "#PLAYER_NAME#'s Old" gear. You set up a shop on a street corner.

When you open your shop in the early morning, people come and sell you items, totalling conveniently all of your gold. You are now broke. (This is where the item buying system is explained.)

When you open your shop again, later in the morning, people come and buy your items, giving you gold again. (This is where the item selling system is explained.)

When you open your shop a third time, in the afternoon, people come to buy items, but find that you have none to sell, except for your "#PLAYER_NAME#'s Old" gear, which your character refuses to sell, for sentimental purposes. You don't gain or lose anything.

At night, a cutscene plays where Stebbins realizes a flaw in his plan: buying and selling loot is all well and good, but if nobody's selling, there will be no loot to stock the shelves with.

The next day, Stebbins mopes about all day, trying to devise a plan, even at one point donning his old starting gear, thinking of setting out to kill monsters for loot on his own. After a few practice swings, though, he resigns to the fact that he is, in fact, Too Old For This Shit, and heads off to the pub in the evening.
