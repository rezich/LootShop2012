Backstory
---------

Everything was good in the world of Acquesitia. Adventurers' endless appetites for acquiring newer and better loot from killing evil creatures ensured that the forces of evil would always be kept at bay.

Then, one day, the Real Money Auction House was established, and everything went to hell. Adventurers could now buy and sell items with their endless supplies of mythical Real Currency, causing the established gold standard to bottom out. After awhile, adventurers stopped using gold to trade items altogether, preferring to deal solely with Real Currency.

While the adventurers of the world traded items and Real Currency back and forth, the forces of evil, no longer being farmed for their loot, rose to power for the first time in milennia. They began to terrorize the civilizations of Acquesitia, and the adventurers, no longer equipped to fight, found themselves unable to fight back.

You are Stebbins, a grizzled old adventurer who was all set to have an easy retirement as an item vendor (as is often the case for aged heroes), but then all this happened. First, vendors were rendered obsolete because of Real Currency, and then the forces of evil rose to power and started terrorizing everyone.

Despite being Too Old For This Shit, Stebbins sets out to right the wrongs of the world, the only way he knows: capitalism.


Act I
-----

__Day 1__

You start off with only a handful a handful of gray items, some gold, and a set of "#PLAYER_NAME#'s Old" gear. You set up a shop on a street corner.

When you open your shop in the early morning, people come and sell you items, totalling conveniently all of your gold. You are now broke. (This is where the item buying system is explained.)

When you open your shop again, later in the morning, people come and buy your items, giving you gold again. (This is where the item selling system is explained.)

When you open your shop a third time, in the afternoon, people come to buy items, but find that you have none to sell, except for your "#PLAYER_NAME#'s Old" gear, which your character refuses to sell, for sentimental purposes. You don't gain or lose anything.

At night, a cutscene plays where Stebbins realizes a flaw in his plan: buying and selling loot is all well and good, but if nobody's selling, there will be no loot to stock the shelves with.

__Day 2__

The next day, Stebbins mopes about all day, trying to devise a plan, even at one point donning his old starting gear, thinking of setting out to kill monsters for loot on his own. After a few practice swings, though, he resigns to the fact that he is, in fact, Too Old For This Shit, and heads off to the pub in the evening.

On his way into the pub, Stebbins runs into a young, Level 1 fighter who just got back from getting the living shit kicked out of him from trying to kill monsters for loot. Stebbins talks to him a bit, and learns that the young fighter, Bash, was trying to follow in his father's footsteps and run some dungeons for loot in an attempt to rise to power and defeat the forces of evil.

But alas, Bash was ill-equipped for the task, literally; his standard Level 1 Fighter starting gear was no match for the now-stronger-than-ever monsters that lurk in the starting dungeons.

After thinking it over, Stebbins gets a brilliant idea, and proposes it to Bash: Stebbins will hire Bash, teach him the ways of the Fighter, give him his coveted first set of uncommon items he ever found. They would set off into the dungeon together, Bash doing the killing and looting, with Stebbins coaching him along the way. Upon returning to town, Stebbins would get all of the loot and a share of the gold, and Bash would get the rest of the gold, with the promise that Stebbins would see to it that Bash gets better gear as they find it.

After some negotiation over rates and accommodations, Bash agrees, and the two head back to the alleyway Stebbins is sleeping in for some rest before morning.

Crazy Story Shit
----------------

Stebbins, once deseased, is followed up by (a perhaps seclusive) son, who in the reality of the game was actually telling the story (unknowinsk to the user). His story was demonstrated by the sound of the lute in the games music. The story was told to glorify his fathers tale, but the gameplay continues with the son in a non-story like fashion. The son is now the user controlled charactor, and can manage the shop (futuresk looking? mild changes to the look of the game?) and adventure on his own (he is still young and agile. 

note: we don't yet have many adversaries or antagonists in the storyboard. 
note: holy shit, we didn't even realize this whole time, but the main theme of the game features a lute. Get it? Lute-shop. (potentially after beating the game the title will change to "Lute-shop"
